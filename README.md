# Inspiration
I was browsing the web looking for existing assistive technology to get
inspiration. I came across the [r/disability
subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/disability) and found [this GIF of a
video](https://www.reddit.com/r/disability/comments/7v9ztc/super_ada_compliant_mario/)
as one of the top upvoted posts of all time. As a gamer myself, I thought
this would a great and fun idea to try and implement as an actual game.

While I had the theme of accessibility at that point, it didn't actually
have any accessibility features. My friend suggested the idea of using eye
tracking from [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/). I looked into it and
ultimately decided on using head tracking for more stability and control.

# What It Does
It is essentially a clone of the original Super Mario Bros, but with the
twist that he can't jump. So, there are ramps and lifts to make up for it.
There are also a variety of input methods to suit whatever method is most
comfortable for the user:
- head movement
- mouse
- keyboard
- controller

# How I Built It
OpenCV and Godot.
